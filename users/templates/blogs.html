        <h2 class="blog-post-title">When you invest in index funds and ETF's , should you choose Sesnsex or Nifty?</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 15, 2021</p>
        <p>In recent times because of their greater performance and reduced cost of investment, index funds have gained in popularity over diversified mutual funds.Warren Buffett  known for being one of the world's most successful investors stated in a 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that index funds are the greatest financial instruments.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Nifty vs Sensex</h3>
        <p>In India, several investment experts like   Raamdeo Agrawal is an Indian businessman, stock market investor and Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group advise clients to include index funds in their main portfolio. However, there are two widely followed indices in India: the S&P BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50. There are 30 stocks in the former and 50 in the latter. Should you choose one index fund over the other if you have to invest in one?</p>
        <br>
        <p>To put it another way, when you invest in an index through an index fund, your investments are made based on each company's weight. An investor might invest $100 in an index fund, for example. The weight of Reliance Industries Ltd and HDFC Bank is roughly 22-25 percent. The fund manager will invest 23 of the 100 dollars in these two businesses.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624996379671-b4d0837e45cb?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80">
        <br><br>
        <p><em>Either option, in our opinion, is acceptable. Both indices have similar historical returns; they both represent a weighted average of India's major corporations, with the top 20 companies receiving the greatest weight while others have a minor weight.</em></p>
        <p>When selecting an index fund, choose the one with the most assets under management (AUMs). In the event that the fund faces redemption pressure, a higher AUM is preferable. The distinction between the two indexes is that the SENSEX includes 30 stocks while the Nifty has 50. Because it has more constituents, Nifty is more "diverse." It is possible for one to outperform another at times.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Investors should be aware of index funds' concentration risk, which can be very high in a single stock, even when compared to actively managed funds, which are required to keep allocation to one stock to a maximum of 10%. Underperformance in HDFC, Reliance, and TCS, for example, can have an impact on an index fund's return.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">How will Omicron affect the stock market?</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 13, 2021</p>
        <p>On the COVID-19 front, things seemed to be getting better. At least, that's what we all believed! Since the pandemic began, India has reported the fewest single-day infection cases. On November 24, 2021, South Africa calls the World Health Organization (WHO) helpline to report that a new strain of the virus, Omicron, has been identified in the nation. So, what impact will the new variation have on the stock market? </p>
        <hr>
        <p>The development of this new strain and its spread around the globe has undoubtedly put a halt to the post-pandemic recovery process, causing stock markets to become restless. Last week, the Sensex and the Nifty witnessed two big drops as a result of these fears. Decisions made by governments to stop the virus from spreading might stifle the global economic recovery, putting the financial markets in jeopardy.</p>
        <h3>Situation of Confusion</h3>
        <p>Stock market players are concerned about how this new variation may effect corporate earnings. Stock markets have become more volatile as a result of this. The stock markets can send investors on a roller-coaster trip until the impact of this new variety is revealed. Whatever the research reveals, stock market players will be on the edge of their seats in the coming days to see what happens!</p>
        <h3>Whether to sell or to hold?</h3>
        <p>Such situations brings up the urge to sell off equity investments and hold cash as an investor. But the loss will be yours if the stock market crosses all hurdles and continues to rise. Investors might also think of pausing their ongoing SIP instalments. However you would be forced to buy shares/MFâ€™s at higher price.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/media-handler.php?mediaPath=https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/misc/2020-12/17/full/markets-stocks-stock-market-coronavirus-1608187732-70112620.jpg&width=1200" width="650px" height="400px">
        <br><br>
        <p>There can be two possibilities from here on. If the Omicron variant is found to have only mild symptoms, it will certainly be a blessing in disguise for the whole world. The spread and severity of this variant can be controlled if this is the case. This will turn out to be a positive scenario for the world.<br><br>The bad- It can set a stage for the virus to show its potential with a third wave in India and across  several parts of the world if this variant is found to be more transmissible and dangerous than the other variants which certainly can have an impact on the businesses and in turn on the stock market.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How to make the most out of this situation?</h3>
        <p>Stick to your investment strategies and stay away from daily market noises is what one can do to counter the situation.<br>
          You can buy at low, if the stock market is trending downwards. However, your money can grow if the market tends to grow upwards.<br>
          A great way to make the most out of this situation is to stick to your investment plans and not get disturbed by daily market volatilities. </p>
